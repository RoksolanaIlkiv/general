    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <h3>
      Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies
      between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.
      When it checks for available suppliers, it moves from the child up. So, if
      the child component has no providers, it will use it from the closest
      parental and only than from the root.
    </h3>

    <hr />
    This behavior can be adjusted using resolution modifiers.

    <ol>
      <li>
        For <b>RootService</b> we create one instance of the service(singleton)
        and use it. So it will be same in any part of our application.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <b>ParentService</b>, the variable was written at the parent
        component level. So will also be available to all children.
      </li>
      <li>
        But for <b>ChildService</b> it provided in parent component and child
        component. Since the component will use the closest available value, we
        will see different results for the child and parent components.
